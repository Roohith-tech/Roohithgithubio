# Inside our earth

## Interior of the earth

Just like an onion, the Earth is made up of several concentric circles layer one inside the other.

### Crust

The uppermost layer is the crust.

It is thinnest of all layers.

It is about 35 Km on the continental masses and 5 Km on the ocean floors.

The main minerals here are silca and aluminia.

It is thus called as <ins>Sial.</ins>

The oceanic crust mainly consist of silca and magnesium.

Thus it is called as <ins>Sima.</ins>

Just beneath the crust
is the mantle which
extends up to a depth of
2900 km. below the crust.

Do you know?

• The deepest mine in
the world, is in
South Africa. It is
about 4 km. deep. In
search for oil
engineers have dug a
hole about 6 km.
deep.

• To reach to the
centre of the earth
(which is not
possible!) you will
have to dig a hole
6000 km. deep on
the ocean floor.

The innermost layer is the core with a radius of about
3500 km.

It is mainly made up of nickel and iron and is
called nife (ni – nickel and fe – ferrous i.e. iron). The
central core has very high temperature and pressure.

**ROCKS AND MINERALS**

The earth’s crust is made up of various types of rocks.

Any natural mass of mineral matter that makes up the
earth’s crust is called a rock. Rocks can be of different
colour, size and texture.

There are three major types of rocks: igneous rocks,
sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks.

When the molten magma cools, it becomes solid.

Rocks thus formed are called igneous rocks.
They are
also called primary rocks.

There are two types of igneous
rocks: intrusive rocks and extrusive rocks.

Can you imagine lava coming out from the volcanoes?

Lava is actually fiery red molten magma coming out from
the interior of the earth on its surface. When this molten
lava comes on the earth’s surface, it rapidly cools down
and becomes solid. 

Rocks formed in such a way on the
crust are called extrusive igneous rocks.

They have a
very fine grained structure.

For example, basalt. The
Deccan plateau is made up of basalt rocks.

Sometimes
the molten magma cools down deep inside the earth’s
crust. Solid rocks so formed are called intrusive igneous
rocks. Since they cool down slowly they form large
grains. Granite is an example of such a rock.

Grinding
stones used to prepare paste/powder of spices and grains
are made of granite.
Rocks roll down, crack, and hit each other and are
broken down into small fragments.

These smaller particles
are called sediments. These sediments are transported
and deposited by wind, water, etc. These loose
sediments are compressed and hardened to form
layers of rocks. 

These types of rocks are called
sedimentary rocks. For example, sandstone is
made from grains of sand.

These rocks may also
contain fossils of plants, animals and other microorganisms that once lived on them.

Igneous and sedimentary rocks can change
into metamorphic rocks under great heat and
pressure .

For example, clay changes into
slate and limestone into marble.

 The remains
of the dead plants and
animals trapped in
the layers of rocks are
called fossils.

**Word Origin**

Igneous: Latin word
Ignis meaning fire.

Sedimentary: Latin
word sedimentum
meaning settle down.

Metamorphic: Greek
word metamorphose
meaning change of form.

**_Do you know?_**

• The crust forms only
1 per cent of the
volume of the earth,
84 per cent consists
of the mantle and
15 per cent makes
the core.

• The radius of the
earth is 6371 km.
